<!-- Hey there! I’m [Your Name], a [year, e.g. junior / senior / second-year] student specializing in Web Design and Application Development at [Your University]. I’m originally from [Your Hometown/State/Country] and currently based in [Your Current City].

I’m passionate about the intersection of creativity and technology — where beautiful design meets smart functionality. Whether I’m building responsive websites, designing intuitive interfaces, or experimenting with new frameworks, I love figuring out how people interact with digital spaces and how to make those experiences smoother, faster, and more enjoyable.

So far, I’ve worked on projects involving [list a few examples — e.g. front-end development, UI/UX design, JavaScript applications, or team-based web projects]. Each project has taught me something new about solving problems, collaborating, and translating ideas into working products.

When I’m not coding or designing, you’ll probably find me [insert something fun and humanizing — e.g. sketching out ideas for side projects, tweaking my personal site for the 100th time, or hunting for good coffee and Wi-Fi].

I’m always learning, building, and exploring new tools — and I’m excited to keep growing as a designer, developer, and creative problem-solver. -->
